# life-expectancy-paper
This study investigates the impact of economic factors on life expectancy using three distinct modeling approaches: linear regression (LM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR). The models were trained and tested on a dataset comprising economic indicators and corresponding life expectancy values. Evaluation metrics including Mean Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Normalized RMSE (NRMSE %), and Percent Bias (PBIAS %) were used to assess model performance. The results indicate that both ANN models (with 5 and 7 hidden layers) consistently outperform the LM and SVR models in terms of lower error rates and higher accuracy. Specifically, the ANN models achieve minimal prediction errors (ME = 0.00) and exhibit lower error percentages (MAE, MSE, RMSE, NRMSE %) compared to the LM and SVR models. The SVR model, while showing a comparable ME to the ANN models, demonstrates higher error rates across all other metrics, indicating a lesser capability to accurately predict life expectancy based on economic variables. This research underscores the efficacy of artificial neural networks in modeling the complex relationship between economic factors and life expectancy, highlighting their potential for informing public health policies and interventions.
